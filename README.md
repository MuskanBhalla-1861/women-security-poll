#Women's Safety
##*This website is all about women's safety across the internet. As we all know in this pandemic period use of all of the official work is going online and have made us and women  especially prone to all kind of cyber threats. So here we first adress the issue of CYBER CRIME then try to find out through the experience of women who have been victim of some kind of cyber crime at one point or the other. Then give them some helpful tips which they can use if they ever find themselves in such situation. At last we create a non-judgemental space where they can share their story and ask for help without looking vulnerable in any sort of way because according to us sometime all we need is someone who can hear us patiently without judging us, so we try to be that someone.*
###As Amelia Earhart said:
>The most difficult thing is the decision to act.
>The rest is merely tenacity.
## So here we request every women to act, to raise their voice and fight for themselves.
